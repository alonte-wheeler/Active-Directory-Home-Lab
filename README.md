<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


<h2> Objective </h2>
The objective of this project is to simulate the deployment of Active Directory (AD) in a virtual environment with a significant number of users, similar to what would be encountered in a large organization or school. The focus will be on understanding the architecture of Active Directory, setting up a robust infrastructure, and efficiently managing a sizable user base (1k users).

This repository contains steps on how I set up a basic home lab running Active Directory following a tutorial by Josh Madakor.
